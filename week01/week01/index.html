        El Empalme, Ecuador 
      </h2>
      <p>
        El Empalme
        Why the name El Empalme? Because the four connecting roads meet: Manab√≠, Guayas, Guayaquil, and Quevedo, at the obelisk where the Velasco Ibarra monument is located, the name of the first parish in this Guayas canton.
        El Empalme, with almost 100,000 inhabitants, was formed by the construction of the Quevedo-Manta highway, which began in 1950, and was cantonized on June 23, 1971.
