        <h2>Alma 7:11</h2>
        <p>
            For behold, I say unto you there be many things 
            to come; and behold, there is one thing which is 
            of more importance than they allâ€”for behold, the time 
            is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh 
            among his people.

        <p>
            32 For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare 
            to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day 
            for men to perform their labors.

        <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
        <p>
            12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of 
            our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your 
            foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, 
            his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm 
            shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to 
            the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are 
            built, which is a sure foundation,
             a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
